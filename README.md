Keeping up with the rapid advancements in AI can be challenging. To ensure I stay informed and retain valuable knowledge, I am embarking on a personal initiative. I plan to not only read about the latest developments but also document and write about what I learn.
This approach will help me consolidate my understanding and complement my master's studies in AI. 
By regularly updating my journal, I aim to deepen my knowledge, stay engaged with the field, and maintain my passion for AI.
