Segment Anything 2 (SAM 2) is a revolutionary foundation model designed to identify and isolate any object within an image or video. 
Building on the capabilities of its predecessor, Segment Anything (SAM), SAM 2 offers enhanced functionality by enabling real-time video segmentation.

There are primarily two main ways to utilize SAM 2:

• Automatic Mask Generation: 
1. This approach segments all discernible objects within an image or video, providing masks for each identified object.
2. Ideal for quickly obtaining masks for all objects in a scene without manual intervention.


• Prompt-Based Segmentation: 
1. This method requires user input in the form of points, boxes, or masks to guide the model in segmenting specific regions of interest.
2. Offers more precise control over the segmentation process, allowing users to focus on specific objects or regions.
